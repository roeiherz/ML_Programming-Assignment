    Description:
    source file with all the relevant code for question 1 (all sections)
    The main function of this file running all the relevant function in order to generate the required output.
    section a: see function "knn"
    section c: see function "get_accuracy_of_k",
               generate plot to file "graph_N_fixed.png" which include the the accuracy when N is fixed for different Ks
    section d: see function "get_accuracy_of_k",
               generate plot to file  "graph_K_fixed.png" which include the the accuracy when K is fixed for different Ns
    Command: "/usr/bin/python NearestNeighbor.py" (for all sections together)
    Note: the output file were already saved in nove.
